# hello-world

Hi, GitHub!

It's the first day that I joined in. I felt suprised by so many coding projects and active users on this platform!

Now I'm still a beginner in coding, but I'll try my best to learn day after day. Fortunatelly, there are so many resources and experts for me to follow.

Thank you, Git! By the way, I really like your Cat icon, haha!

Yours,
Sen Wang
